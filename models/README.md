# AirBnB Clone - The Console

## Project Description

The AirBnB Clone - The Console is a command-line interface (CLI) for a simplified version of the AirBnB website. This project serves as a fundamental component for managing and interacting with the AirBnB application's data and resources through the command line. It allows users to create, view, update, and delete objects like users, places, and bookings. The project uses Python and includes various commands to perform these actions, all accessible from the command line.

The project aims to replicate the functionality of the AirBnB platform, including the ability to manage user accounts, property listings, bookings, reviews, and more. It provides a powerful yet user-friendly command-line interface to interact with these features.

## BaseModel Class Description

The `BaseModel` class is the foundation of the AirBnB Clone project, defining common attributes and methods that other classes in the project inherit. It includes the following attributes and methods:

### Public Instance Attributes

- `id`: A unique identifier generated using `uuid.uuid4()` to ensure each `BaseModel` instance has a distinct ID.
- `created_at`: A timestamp set to the current datetime when an instance is created.
- `updated_at`: A timestamp set to the current datetime when an instance is created and updated every time the object changes.

### Public Instance Methods

- `save(self)`: Updates the `updated_at` attribute with the current datetime, indicating changes to the object.
- `to_dict(self)`: Returns a dictionary containing all keys and values of the instance's `__dict__`. It also includes a `__class__` key with the class name and converts the `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps to ISO-formatted strings.

### `__str__` Method

The `__str__` method provides a formatted string representation of the object in the following format:
```
[<class name>] (<self.id>) <self.__dict__>
```

This method enhances object visualization.

## How to Start It

To start the AirBnB Clone - The Console, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/airbnb-clone-console.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd airbnb-clone-console
   ```

3. Run the command interpreter:

   ```shell
   ./console.py
   ```

## How to Use It

The command interpreter provides a set of commands that can be executed in the following format:

```
(hbnb) command [options]
```

Here are some example commands you can use:

- To create a new object, use the `create` command:

  ```
  (hbnb) create User
  ```

- To retrieve objects, you can use the `show`, `all`, or `count` commands:

  ```
  (hbnb) show User 12345
  (hbnb) all Place
  (hbnb) count Amenity
  ```

- To update an object, use the `update` command:

  ```
  (hbnb) update Place 54321 name "New Name"
  ```

- To delete an object, use the `destroy` command:

  ```
  (hbnb) destroy Review 98765
  ```

- To quit the console, use the `quit` or `EOF` command:

  ```
  (hbnb) quit
  ```
